Q: How do we create an object in Ruby? Give an example of the creation of an object.

My answer:
We create an object through the process of instantiation. You can either call a class.new method, like `String.new`, or you can initialize a variable to a value of an object, like `var = 6`

LS answer:
We create an object by defining a class and instantiating it by using the .new method to create an instance, also known as an object.

class MyClass
end

my_obj = MyClass.new
