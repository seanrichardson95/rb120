=begin
Which of the following are objects in Ruby? If they are objects, how can you find out what class they belong to?

1. true
2. "hello"
3. [1, 2, 3, "happy days"]
4. 142

My answer:
-they're all objects
-you can find out what object they are by using .class

=end


puts true.class
puts "hello".class
puts [1, 2, 3, "happy days"].class
puts 142.class
